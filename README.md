Something Awful Last Read Redux Extension for Chrome
==============================================

This is a port of the SALR extension for Firefox to Google Chrome. It adds a number of improvements to the Something Awful Forums on Chrome.

Installation
------------

To install, download the latest version from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/something-awful-last-read/bogegdelcjhoaakaepmoglademmhiboo "Web Store"). This will handle all updates automatically for you.

Alternatively, this can be added to chrome manually by downloading /extension/ and using the unpack option within the extensions page under Developer Mode. (Not Recommended for casual users, as updates will not be pushed automatically.)

Bug Reporting
-------------

If you run into any issues using this extension, please report them in the appropriate [SA Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3208437 "SA Thread").

Development  
-----------  

All work on SALR Redux happens in this repository. The master branch will contain the base code for the latest release on the chrome web store. The "dev" branch will generally contain my _in-progress_ work and is as such not recommended for people to use ever. However, if people want to contribute, looking towards that branch might be best. If a critical bug comes out during work on the next dev release, I may just apply the patch directly to the master and then push that to the "dev" branch. All changes are recorded in the the [Changelog](https://github.com/MasterOdin/salr-chrome/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
